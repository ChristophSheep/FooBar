a Clean up yourself with guides
b I am cleaning up your code

Help in every phase of your development
In every phase you can stop to produce unclean code.
The earlier you catch the better it is.

IBM Researcher find out that 

Costs | Phase

  1   | Design
 10   | Implementation
 15   | Test
100   | Production

## Setup phase (Pre-Design)

### Team finding

I believe to have people in team that are not called
as developers are the biggest source of unclean code.

Do you not know that just a little leaven ferments the whole batch?
```

To find a good team with people that really work together
is the most difficult part. I would say.
The first book about non-tech issues in computer programming
was the book "Psychology of Computer Programming" from
Gerald M. Weinberg.

Here is the table of contents. That he wrote about
*social* and *individual* activity.

### Calling

It is important to find people that are not programmer
because of money. They should be called to be a programmer.
Donald Knuth said that in his courses at university each
year he only find 2 people under 200 that seems to real
called. 

## Design phase

In the design phase you can make the right decision to low prizes.
The higher it goes the more it costs.

Plan you application. Like an architect for a house.
Do not start coding to soon.

## Test phase

I did not belong so much on tests. Most unit tests I saw
are nonsense. And really tests only a small part, but you
does not feel more secure.

### TDD

Test-driven-development is now a standard of a hipe.
I could remember times where the code quality was much
higher then today with TDD. We develop a peace of code
and tested this small part immediately. And the code was
more stable. Nobody hack around in your code. We work
more library based thinking. And created for general to use
class that have not to be changed very often from other
people you did not know that this class is doing.

## Implementation phase

### Clean coding

## In production phase

Refactoring to clean code
