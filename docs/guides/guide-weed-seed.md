# `Weed Seed`

## Introduction

If you start with a bad design or architecture
and only an unclean approach, then it is the
same as you growing weed seed. Your code is growing and growing and gettings uglier and uglier over the years. Until it is uncontrolled and hard to maintain. If you cut weed it is growing more and more.

Or if your architecture and core classes are not set right and
grow this up. It is like having a cornerstone for building a house.
Which is not strait in each direction. If you build up the house it
will get lean (schief, lehnen).

## Solution

The only solution for that is to stop to build.
Bring the cornerstone in right place and build up from this
stone right.

If you can not do that seek something you knows.

## Problem

If you have a software that is in production and you can not stop it. And also have to build in new feature your weed and also growing more and more.
I worked on a software that was growing more and more and we could not control it anymore.
