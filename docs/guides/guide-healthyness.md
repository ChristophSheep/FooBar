# Healthyness

## Introduction

I personal believe that unclean code can lead to physical unhealthyness.
in every kind of different forms.

Stress -> Heart, Kreislauf
Confusing -> Brain
Stief neck -> Dizzyness

## Solution

If you see that you have physical problems with unclean code and co-worker.
Try to work from home or try to find another job.
I suggest to lock at the code if you apply for a new job.
Why? The code is the fruit of the tree of the work of the whole
company. You can see on the fruit of the whole company is healthy or not.
Even if you do not if the problematic part is in management or software
development or wherever. 

```A bad tree never produce good fruit```

## Problem

If you work un unclean code and not detect ealier enough you get
cooked. 
A frog that get cooked slowly will not jump out of the pod.
If a frog jumps into a pod of hot water we will immediately jump
out. But if you put him in to cold water and warm it up slowly
he will get tired and sleep in and get cooked on the end.
It is a trap where you can not so easy escape because it is not
so offensichtlich. Like the enviroment change every years slowly
you get used to it. But if someone get frozen for 50 years and
wake up we would immediately notice something is wrong with
the weather. The forest look sick. The winter have no snow and
are very warm. You have a lot of strange weather phenomens.
He would notice this because the different is so big.
