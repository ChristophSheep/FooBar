## Blaming culture

In a blaming culture company of messed up code
always the others are the problem. The boss was
the problem because we does not enough
developer from the beginning. Perhaps true,
but not the truth.

Some produce mess code and when new people came
and then work with this messed up code they mess
it up more and more and then they get blamed.

Some are not called to be product owner and blame
others.

Some are not called to be software developer and
blame others.

Some are not called to be IT manager and blame
others.

All other wrong.
